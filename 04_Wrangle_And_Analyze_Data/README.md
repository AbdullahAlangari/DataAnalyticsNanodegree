# Wrangling and Analysing Data

In this process I went over the Data Analysis Process one more time, this tine gathering my own data using python web and understood using APIs such as tweeoy (Twitter's development API)

I identified and fixed 10 issues with the data, and created a report for them, and then polished it with some visualizations that helped me draw conclusions and write a conclusion report for this project.
